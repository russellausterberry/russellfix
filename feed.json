            "content_html": "<p>From a lifetime wrangling computers, I've got some broad recommendations - some of them 'the road less travelled'.</p>\n<h4>spend more on a smartphone than on a laptop</h4>\n<p>A smartphone is now a fully grown up member of the computer club, and with all it's sensors, cameras and apps can do a truly mind-boggling array of things. If you only get one device, get a smartphone - and pay as much as you can afford for something that will last 4 years or more.</p>\n<p>If need the larger screen size and productivity go for a laptop - but in this case my recommendation is to look for 2nd hand refurbished machines. Ex-government machines in particular are actually commerical grade gear rather than the flimsier retail-grade laptops you'll be tempted to buy new on a budget. In many cases refurbished machines are cheaper and actually better!¬†</p>\n<h4>consider upgrading rather than buying new</h4>\n<p>If you have something up to about six years old that is annoyingly slow and you're thinking of getting a new machine... first check how far a little upgrading could go.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add RAM. RAM (memory) is like desktop space. If you have a big desktop, you can reach a lot of things quickly. If your desktop is too small, you need to turn and reach into the filing cabinet - which takes much more time. If your computer has too little RAM it stores 'desktop' stuff in the HDD (hard disk drive) which is just painfully slow. Up to a point, more RAM is a cheap simple way to speed up your computer.</li>\n<li>Put in an SSD (solid state drive). An SSD has no moving parts and is <em>very</em> quick compared to the old spinning disk type of drive. Of course you'll need to save files and re-install your operating system for this one...</li>\n<li>Upgrade your CPU (central processing unit). This should be the¬†<em>last</em> thing you consider upgrading, as the first two measures will bring a lot of zip into even quite old computers. But if you want to squeeze more speed, it's a possiblity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>try Linux</h4>\n<p>I'm something of a Linux evangelist, and have now spent more time using Ubuntu (a version of LInux) than I have using Windows (and I started with Windows 95 on a set of floppy disks!).</p>\n<p>YES, for many it's something new and comes with a bit of a learning curve... however in my experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux is free. (Actually you can also install¬† Windows 10 for free if you don't mind occasional nagging to register.¬†<em>You don't have to!</em>)</li>\n<li>Installation is simple. In less than an hour I can do a clean install of Ubuntu, browse the web and have a word processor and spreadsheet as good as MS Office, all¬†<em>FREE.</em> I find I need 3 or 4 hours to do likewise with Windows, with more reboots along the way.</li>\n<li>No marketing tentacles. You¬†<em>can</em> sign up for an account but it's easy to fly completely under the radar.</li>\n<li>You probably don't need antivirus. There's debate on this, but Linux is very secure out of the box.¬†</li>\n<li>Linux is more reliable. I reboot Ubuntu machine only once or twice a fortnight; with Windows that seems to happen much more often.</li>\n<li>Desktop experience is great. Nowadays you can go a long way on the desktop without having to dive into the command line, it's on a par with Windows in terms of ease of use.</li>\n<li>There's¬†<em>heaps</em> of functionality for free. Browser, Office suite, PDF viewer, movie viewer... and plenty of software installable at a click.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's more... the internet pretty much runs on Linux servers, you can get stripped down versions which happily run on old machines and - in case you didn't know - Android (the operating system on half the phones out there) is a version of Linux. Linux <em>rocks</em>. You just won't find it pre-installed on a laptop in a shop (yet).</p>\n<p>¬†</p>",
