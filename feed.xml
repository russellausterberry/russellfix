                <h3>cars - vans - boats</h3>
<p>I've spent over a year as an apprentice electrician on island, getting used to those invisible electrons and how they work. While you need a licensed electrician for any 240v work, I'm quite able to tackle most of the electrical challenges in bikes, boats, buggies, vans or e-bikes.</p>
<h3>TV systems</h3>
<p>I'm gearing up to be able to diagnose and fix faults with your TV setup, from the antenna down.</p>
